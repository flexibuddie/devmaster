    <p><em>This is the story of <strong> Ureh House of Commotion.</strong></em></p>
    <p> There was a time we were two families in a house of four rooms which we called a <a href= https://www.thefreedictionary.com/home>home</a>  </p>
    <p>The days we shared together and the moments we had reminds me of the true love that existed within the family. </p>
    <p>We celebrated the good days and the not so good days together such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Birthdays</li>
        <li>Graduations</li>
        <li>Burials</li>
        <li>TV shows</li>
    </ul>
